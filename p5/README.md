## Summary
This project was completed as the second challenge project of 
ECS 60, the Data Structures and Programming course at the
University of California, Davis, taught by Sean Davis.

## Strategy
I originally planned to run Djikstras Algorithm on every node, but
soon realized that this would take O(n^2) time. I then changed the algorithm
to transform from a multiple source - multiple sink graph problem to a min energy 
max flow problem by adding a dummy source and sink node with infinite edge capacity, with
the only limiting factors as the energy generated by certain nodes. 
In the end, I used a Breadth First Search that pushes out energy - It starts
from the earliest City in the CityList, and find the Cities with excess energy
to give. Those perform Breadth First Search, transferring energy along paths
to Cities that can receive energy until those source cities are out of energy.
