ECS 60: Data Structures and Programming
Instructor: Sean Davis


1. [p1](./p1) TimeTest 1
  * Record the times of different structures with different implementations and explain why said data structure works better or worse on different sets of inputs. 
2. [p2](./p2) B+ Tree
  * B+ Tree
3. [p3](./p3) TimeTest 2
  * Continuation on TimeTest 1, but with more data structures
4. [p4](./p4) Compression
  * Huffman Encoding
  * Note: I originaly coded Lempel - Ziv - Welch Compression which had a better compression ratio, but took much too long. 
5. [p5](./p5) Graph Algorithms
  * Our solution for the Graph Power Grid Network problem was to give each node a value (how much energy it needs to give/take). Then, we used Breadth First Search with backflow to minimize transfers.
