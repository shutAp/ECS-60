ECS 60: Data Structures and Programming


Instructor: Sean Davis


1. [p1](./p1) TimeTest 1
  * Record the times of different structures with different implementations and explain why said data structure works better or worse on different sets of inputs. 
2. [p2](./p2) B+ Tree
  * B+ Tree
3. [p3](./p3) TimeTest 2
  * Continuation on TimeTest 1, but with more data structures
4. [p4](./p4) Compression - Challenge Prompt 1
  * Huffman Encoding
  * Note: I originaly coded Lempel - Ziv - Welch Compression which had a better compression ratio, but took much too long. 
5. [p5](./p5) Graph Algorithms - Challenge Prompt 2
  * My solution for the Graph Power Grid Network problem was to give each node a value (how much energy it needs to give/take). Then, we used Breadth First Search with backflow to minimize transfers. 
  * I originally planned to run Djikstras on every node, but soon realized that this would take O(n^2) time. I then changed the algorithm to transform from a multiple source - multiple sink graph problem to a min energy max flow problem by adding a dummy source and sink node with infinite edge capacity, with the only limiting factors as the energy generated by certain nodes. In the end, I used a Breadth First Search that pushes out energy - it starts from the earliest City in the CityList, and finds Cities with excess energy to give. Those perform Breadth First Search, transferring energy along paths to Cities that can receive energy until source cities are out of energy.
